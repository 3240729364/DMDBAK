# Benchmark for Human Back Acupuncture Point Detection
A publicly available dataset specialized for the detection of keypoints on human back acupoints has been pioneered and constructed by this paper: DMD-BAK(*Data science,Machine learning & Dynamical control:Back Acupoints Keypoints*).
The performance of deep learning keypoint detection networks with different paradigms, architectures, and features on the back acupoint dataset was comprehensively analyzed by this paper.
